# studivz-visualizer
... is an attempt to visualize the studiVZ-json files and images generated by the [studivz-crawler](https://github.com/fabianludwig/studivz-crawler)

**Attention**: Make sure you crawled with at least one user, therefore having a downlaods-folder including an `accounts.json` and username-folder and to point to the right folder in the `src/data.js`

For now it supports the friendslist with tabs for showing the messages and pinboard
